Clayball Fighter
================

Entry to the Ludum Dare 31 Jam, with the theme "Entire Game On One Screen". It's written in Java because that was the "greatest common denominator" in our team.

Clayball Fighter, based on the original Polandball comics (http://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/2cxvcg/clayball_fighter_1/) by Black_Mirror (with his/her blessing), is a fighter game that lets Balls representing different countries face off against each other.

## Features

- Play as United States, United Kingdom, or Sweden
- US (Western) and SE (IBÖRKA, the furniture retailer) Arenas
- Bounce, jump, double jump, and standard attack (with randomized damage)
- Stereotypical intro and outro screens

## Controls

- Left: WASD for movement, Left CTRL to choose/attack, Space to jump
- Right: Arrow keys for movement, Right CTRL to choose/attack, Numpad 0 to jump (try numlock if it doesn't work)
