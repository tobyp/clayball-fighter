Clayball Fighter
================

Entry to the Ludum Dare 31 Jam, with the theme "Entire Game On One Screen". It's written in Java because that was the "greatest common denominator" in our team.

Clayball Fighter, based on the original Polandball comics (http://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/2cxvcg/clayball_fighter_1/) by Black_Mirror (with his/her blessing), is a fighter game that lets Balls representing different countries face off against each other.

## Features

- Play as China, Sweden, United Kingdom, or United States
- US (Western) and SE (IBÃ–RKA, the furniture retailer) Arenas
- Bounce, jump, double jump, slam, standard attack, projectile attack, and special attack

## Controls

- Left: `WASD` for movement, `C` to choose/attack, `V` for projectile
